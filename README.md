### Running your React Native application
I'm new to mobile development, so I started with Expo CLI.

Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open this project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
